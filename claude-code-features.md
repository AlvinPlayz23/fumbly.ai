Implement advanced codebase analysis features including dependency mapping, architecture visualization, and code quality metrics



Codebase Understanding: Automatically grasps project architecture, dependencies, and logic without manual configuration, according to Anthropic.
Code Editing and Refactoring: Modifies and optimizes code, suggests improvements, and refactors for readability or standards adherence.
Bug Fixing and Debugging: Identifies errors, suggests fixes, and can implement corrections and verify solutions by running tests.
Automated Testing and Linting: Executes test suites, fixes failing tests, and applies linting rules to maintain code quality, states Anthropic.
Git Integration: Performs Git operations like searching history, resolving conflicts, creating commits, and generating pull requests through natural language commands.
Documentation Generation: Creates or updates documentation, adding comments, docstrings, and ensuring adherence to project standards.
Web Search: Accesses online resources and documentation to gather additional context for coding tasks.
MCP Integration: Utilizes Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend capabilities, connecting with tools like databases, APIs, or external data sources.
Terminal-native Integration: Works directly in the terminal, integrating with your existing development environment and command-line tools seamlessly.
IDE Integrations: Provides dedicated integrations for popular IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.
Headless Mode: Enables non-interactive execution for automation in scripts and CI/CD pipelines.
Extended Thinking: Allows for deeper analysis and planning before executing tasks, leading to more robust solutions.
Security and Privacy: Connects directly to Anthropic's API and requires explicit approval for sensitive actions, ensuring data protection.
Custom Slash Commands: Allows creating reusable commands for quick execution of specific prompts or tasks, states DataCamp.
Memory Management: Remembers preferences and context across sessions using CLAUDE.md files.
Multi-language Support: Works with numerous programming languages and frameworks.
